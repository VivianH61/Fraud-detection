# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning & Python
# Introduction
As we are moving towards the digital world — cybersecurity is becoming a crucial part of our life. When we talk about security in digital life then the main challenge is to find the abnormal activity. When we make any transaction while purchasing any product online — a good amount of people prefer credit cards. The credit limit in credit cards sometimes helps us me making purchases even if we don’t have the amount at that time. On the other hand, these features are misused by cyber attackers. To tackle this problem we need a system that can abort the transaction if it finds fishy.

# Dataset
We process three kinds of datasets in this project. Different methods are used for different types of datasets.
1. Labeled data
Flag fraudulent transactions with supervised learning. Use classifiers, adjust and compare them to find the most efficient fraud detection model.
2. Unlabeled data
Use unsupervised learning techniques to detect fraud. Segment customers, use K-means clustering and other clustering algorithms to find suspicious occurrences in your data.
3. Text files
Use text data, text mining and topic modeling to detect fraudulent behavior.
